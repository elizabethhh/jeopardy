This was my first time using APIs and learning AngularJS! I had only taken an Intro CS class prior to this but I really enjoyed learning something outside of class and actually doing a real project that people can access online!

Things I learned/features I implemented:
- Searching for category ID, difficulty level, dates (calls to API every time a search is typed in). Initially, I only made one call and filtered by these categories
- How to use APIs/Angular (thanks to many online tutorials and Stack Overflow)
- Multiple searches so that you can search for category ID AND difficulty level
 
What I would implement if I had more time:
- UI/UX Design, specifically
- Button to make API call to random
